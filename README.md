# Hello there, welcome to my github page! 

I am a self-taught web developer focusing on frontend development. I enjoy using the **HTML5, CSS3** and **JavaScrip**t core languages together 
with **SASS** and **React** in creating responsive web pages.


It took quite a time of trying and exploring different programming languages from both frontend and backend but here are some of my works! ðŸ˜„
